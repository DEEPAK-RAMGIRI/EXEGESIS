üîπ Introduction

Text summarization is the process of reducing a long passage of text into a shorter version while retaining the most important information. In this text summarization, we demonstrate two approaches: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization works by identifying and selecting the most important sentences from the original text, while abstractive summarization goes further by rewriting the text into a more natural and human-like summary using deep learning models.

üîπ Preprocessing

The workflow begins with preprocessing, where the text is cleaned by converting it to lowercase, removing stopwords (common words like the, is, and that do not add much meaning), and stripping punctuation. This step ensures that only meaningful words contribute to the analysis. After preprocessing, we move to feature extraction using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency ‚Äì Inverse Document Frequency) method.

Term Frequency (TF) ‚Üí measures how often a word appears in a sentence.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) ‚Üí reduces the weight of very common words and increases the importance of rare but meaningful words.
Together, TF-IDF is a way of vectorization (converting sentences into numerical vectors so that algorithms can process them).

üîπ Feature Extraction and Sentence Scoring

Once we vectorize the text, each sentence is represented as a vector of word importance scores. To rank sentences, we calculate a sentence score by summing the TF-IDF values of all words in that sentence. Sentences with higher scores are considered more informative. For example, a sentence containing rare but meaningful words like healthcare or experts will score higher than one with common words like AI or world. By ranking sentences in this way, we can automatically identify which ones contribute the most to the overall meaning of the passage. The top-ranked sentences are then selected to form the extractive summary, which is concise but still composed of original text from the document.

üîπ Abstractive Summarization

To improve readability and naturalness, we apply abstractive summarization using a pre-trained deep learning model, facebook/bart-large-cnn, from Hugging Face. This model is built on Transformers (a type of neural network architecture specialized in handling text sequences). The model reads the extractive summary and generates new sentences, rather than just copying. For example, instead of simply selecting sentences about AI‚Äôs benefits and growth, the model can generate a smooth summary like: ‚ÄúAI is improving efficiency and saving lives across industries, and experts predict it will expand rapidly in the next decade.‚Äù

üîπ Conclusion

Overall, text summarization highlights how combining extractive and abstractive methods provides a powerful summarization pipeline. Extractive techniques ensure that the most important points are captured, while abstractive models refine the output into natural language. By integrating NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for preprocessing), Scikit-learn (machine learning library for TF-IDF scoring), and Hugging Face Transformers (deep learning models for natural language generation), we achieve an end-to-end text summarization system that is both accurate and human-like.
